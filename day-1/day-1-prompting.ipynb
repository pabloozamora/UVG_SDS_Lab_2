    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",

    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

From its ancient roots in Mediterranean civilization to its contemporary presence in global markets and research labs, the olive’s influence permeates various aspects of human life, impacting economies, cultures, and even health.  Its significance extends beyond mere sustenance, encompassing environmental sustainability, economic stability for numerous communities, and the promise of future advancements in health and wellness.\n",

Beyond its use as a food source, olive oil was crucial in religious rituals, used for anointing and as a symbol of peace and prosperity. The olive branch, a potent symbol of peace, continues to resonate in modern times, its image readily recognizable and universally understood. This rich history imbues the olive\n"

He sniffed at blooming honeysuckle, chased butterflies in a sun-dappled meadow, and even climbed a tree, the view from the top dizzying and breathtaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "His adventure took him through the bustling streets, past barking dogs and chattering pigeons. He encountered a grumpy old tabby who warned him of the dangers lurking in the shadows, and a playful kitten who taught him the art of pouncing shadows. He learned to navigate the city maze, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, his heart pounding with an exhilarating fear.\n",

      "A storm rolled in, painting the sky with shades of grey and unleashing a torrent of rain. Bartholomew found shelter under the awning of a bakery, the warmth of the freshly baked bread a comforting aroma in the swirling storm. As he sat there, watching the rain wash the streets clean, he felt a strange sense of longing for home.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found his way back to the window, tired but exhilarated. He squeezed back into his house, the familiar scent of his human’s comforting presence filling his senses. As he curled up on his rug, a purr resonating deep within him, he knew his life had changed. He was still Bartholomew, the ginger tom who loved his naps and his sunbeams, but now, there was a spark of adventure in his eyes, a memory of the wind in his fur and the taste of freedom on his tongue.\n",

He knew there were more adventures waiting, just beyond his reach, and a part of him would always yearn for them. But for now, he was content with his home, his warmth, and the quiet comfort of being Bartholomew, the ginger tom who had ventured beyond his world and returned a little wiser, a little braver, and a little more alive. \n",
